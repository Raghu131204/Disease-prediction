# Disease-prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm(RandomForest Classifier)
## Problem Overview
This project uses machine learning to develop automated models that predict diseases based on symptoms, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and overall healthcare efficiency.
The main goal of the project is to building a accurate model to predict the 42 different disease based on the 132 different symptoms .
## Algorithm Used:
#### Random Forest Classifier: 
A claasification type algorithm used since the data set is of type binary(input features are in 0's and 1's)
