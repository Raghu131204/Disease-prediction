# Disease-prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm(RandomForest Classifier)
## Problem Overview
This project uses machine learning to develop automated models that predict diseases based on symptoms, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and overall healthcare efficiency.
The main goal of the project is to building a accurate model to predict the 42 different disease based on the 132 different symptoms .
## Project Objectives
The project follows these key steps:

1) Data Gathering: Collected relevant medical data from Kaggle.
2) Descriptive Analysis: Explored the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and trends.
3) Data Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations to represent key relationships in the data.
4) Data Preprocessing:Since targes column is categorical type label encoding is performed .
5) Data Modelling: Trained a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict diseases.
6) Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy.
   
## Algorithm Used:
#### Random Forest Classifier: 
A claasification type algorithm used since the data set is of type binary(input features are in 0's and 1's)
