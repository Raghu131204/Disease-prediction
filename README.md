# Disease-prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm(RandomForest Classifier)
## Problem Overview
This project uses machine learning to develop automated models that predict diseases based on symptoms, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and overall healthcare efficiency.
The main goal of the project is to building a accurate model to predict the 42 different disease based on the 132 different symptoms .
## Machine Learning Algorithm:
Since the entire data set is of type binary data the best suitable algorithm to solve this problem is Classification Algorithms like Random Forest classifier,Logistic Regression,Support vectore machine.But in this project the algorithm chosen is ### Random Forest Classifier
